# KMITL Elective Course Scanner
A Python program that scans all links for elective courses in KMITL. For a detailed explanation of how the program works, see `Fooba_Course_Scanner.pdf`.

**About the name:** *Fooba* comes from the names *Foofy* and *Doba*, literally, which we wanted to play it as a homophone of the word *Foobar*, a placeholder name usually being referenced in computer programming.
